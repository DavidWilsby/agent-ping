# Changelog

## [1.0.14] — 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- Permission prompt sound now plays instantly — restored `PermissionRequest` hook which fires before the dialog appears, instead of relying on the slower `Notification` event
- CLI no longer waits for stdin before playing sounds, eliminating a 5–10 second delay caused by Claude Code keeping the pipe open
- macOS `afplay` now runs detached instead of blocking, so sequential hooks don't queue behind each other

### Changed
- `Notification` hook uses `--filtered` mode to skip `permission_prompt` (already handled by `PermissionRequest`), avoiding double sounds

---

## [1.0.13] — 2026-03-24

### Changed
- Hooks now call `agent-ping` directly instead of `npx --yes agent-ping@latest`, eliminating ~500ms registry latency on every event
- Global install (`npm i -g agent-ping`) is now required — the extension shows a warning with a **Retry** button if the binary is not found
- Old npx-style hooks are migrated to direct binary calls automatically on activation

---

## [1.0.12] — 2026-03-24

### Changed
- Simplified to two sounds: **Notification** and **Stop**
- Notification sound now plays only for actionable events (`permission_prompt`, `idle_prompt`, `elicitation_dialog`) and stop failures — not every notification
- Removed `PermissionRequest` hook (was causing permission sound to play twice); permissions are now handled via the `Notification` hook's `notification_type` field
- Added `StopFailure` hook to play notification sound on API errors (rate limits, billing issues)
- Removed detection logic and transcript reading — no longer reads Claude's messages to decide whether to play a sound
- Removed debounce (was a workaround for the now-fixed double-play bug)

### Removed
- Permission sound setting (merged into Notification sound)
- Question detection settings
- `PermissionRequest` hook (legacy hook cleaned up automatically on extension activate)
